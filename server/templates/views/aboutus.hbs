                <p>Travel is all about experience, itâ€™s not only about research and facts. We might have spent many days travelling, trying
                to know about places, its season, its weather, its culture, its tradition, festivals which are celebrated there and the
                way of tourism offered by them. Travel blogging enhances our travel experience, it forces us to be more aware of the
                places we plan to travel, or the places we have already visited. In our website people can read our blogs and as well as
                share their travel experience and photos about place by writing a blog by signing up in our website.
