                <p>Travel is all about experience, it’s not only about research and facts. We might have spent many days travelling, trying
                to know about places, its season, its weather, its culture, its tradition, festivals which are celebrated there and the
                way of tourism offered by them. Travel blogging enhances our travel experience, it forces us to be more aware of the
                places we plan to travel, or the places we have already visited. In our website people can read our blogs and as well as
                share their travel experience and photos about place by writing a blog by signing up in our website. Admin can read that
                blog and approve the blog if he likes which is written by any user, If the admin doesn’t like that particular blog, he
                can delete that. Users who wants to tavel and doesn't know about particular place they can visit our website and they
                will get an idea by reading the blogs we upload and also write one on their own. Users can login whenever they want.
