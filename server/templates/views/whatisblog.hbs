        <h1>What is a Blog?</h1>
        <p>
        A blog is a type of website that is updated regularly in the form of posts. These posts can be stories and/or snippets
        of information, reviews, photographs, images, podcasts and other types of content that can be uploaded online.<br>
        <br>
        More often than not, a blog is written from the perspective of one person or a couple/small group. Large companies are
        embedding blogs into their main website to explain products/services in more detail and to attract internet traffic to
        their main website. Zurich Life’s Cost of Education blog the best example of such a strategy.<br>
        <br>
        A travel blog is simply a blog where the entire focus is on the world of travel.

    <h1>A blogger is a person who writes blogs…right?</h1>
    <p>Correct…sort of. A blogger is someone who creates a blog, regularly uploads content to that blog and subsequently
    publishes it as a post.<br>
    
    Blogging is a multimedia endeavour, involving more than just writing which is why bloggers are often called Content
    Creators. Content is King is the most popular phrase in a blogger’s lexicon and most bloggers use a mix of content in
    their posts.<br>
    Blogging doesn’t stop with publishing a post as most bloggers market their posts using social media (i.e. Facebook,
    Twitter etc.) and engage in online discussions to promote it further. Many bloggers sell products on their site and some
    are lucky enough to be invited to events as paid speakers.</p>
